1. What is the maximum value that the SysTick counter can start counting down from?
(2-^24)-1 = 16777215

2. What are the addresses of the CTRL, LOAD and VAL registers?
CTRL, 0xE000E010
LOAD, 0xE000E014
VAL 0xE000E018

3. To use register names (CTRL, LOAD and VAL) in my assembly code, how to define
them? (Hint : EQU)
SYSTICK_CTRL EQU 0xE000E010
SYSTICK_LOAD EQU 0xE000E014
SYSTICK_VAL EQU 0xE000E018

4. What is the value to be written in the LOAD register to activate the SysTick interrupt
every 2 ms, in case the Clock Source is 12MHz?
LOAD value = (12000000 X 0,002) - 1 = 23999

5. What are the clock sources that you choose from to configure the SysTick?
CLKSOURCE, TICKINT, ENABLE.
