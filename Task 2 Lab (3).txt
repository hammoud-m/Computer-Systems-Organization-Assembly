1. What happens to the stack in the event of SysTick interrupt?
it saves specific data in the stack

2. What is saved on the stack in the event of SysTick interrupt?
R0-R3. R12, PC, PSR, LR

3. What is in the LR register when the SysTick interrupt handler is executing, and what
does it mean?
0xFFFFFFF9, EXC_RETURN

4. What instruction causes the SysTick interrupt to end, i.e. how do you return to the main
program?
BX LR

5. Where is the return address stored?
in the stack

6. What are the shared resources between the main program and the SysTick Handler?
R6
7. What is the maximum value that the Binary counter of the main program reaches?
Why?

8. Do you recognise any sensitive code section in this program? Where is it?
Yes, CMP R6, #0x0
     SUB R6, R0, R3

9. If you recognise a sensitive code section in your program, How can you protect it? (Hint:
Do not use PUSH and POP)
disable interrupts before using R6 in loop & enable it after it.
